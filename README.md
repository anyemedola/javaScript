# javaScript

## Comments

In javaScript codes we do use comments made with // (for one line/ line by line) and /**/ (multiple lines) to leave notes for ourselves or others who will later help us to figure out what the code does. Using the two types of comments will tell javaScript to ignore those lines. 

EX:
// Author: Any Medola 
/* imagine a text description by the author */

## Declare javaScript variables

In **computer science**, ==data== is anything that is meaningful for the computer. JvaScript has 8 different ==data types==: *undefined*, *null*, *boolean*, *string*, *symbol*, *bigint*, *number* and *object*.

Computers can distinguish between numbers(==12==) and sring(=="12"==), which are collections of characters so they can perfome mathematical operations on a number and not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in dynamic way. Using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight types of data can be storage in variables.

We can create a variable in javaScipt by putting the keyword ==var== in front of it

EX:
var ourName;

Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
